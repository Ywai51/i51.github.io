    <h2>God of Thunder</h2>
    <img alt="thor" src="thor2.jpg" id="leftImg" />
    <p>In Germanic mythology, Thor (/θɔːr/; from Old Norse: Þórr, runic ᚦᚢᚱ þur) is a hammer-wielding god associated with thunder, lightning, storms, oak trees, strength, the protection of mankind and also hallowing and fertility. Besides Old Norse Þórr, extensions of the god occur in Old English as Þunor and in Old High German as Donar (runic ᚦᛟᚾᚨᚱ þonar). All forms of the deity stem from a Common Germanic *Þunraz (meaning thunder). </em> <img alt="" src="thor.jpg" id="rightImg" />
